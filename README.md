# Blackjack
A terminal-level version of the game "Blackjack".

Language: C++
Date: 3/10/2025

A small recreation of the classic casino game "Blackjack". I Originally started work on this project during an assignment in CS1570: Intro to C++.
I really enjoyed completing the assignment, so I decided to clean it up a bit and make it look nice. I will probably comeback to this every few months
to optimize the program a bit more and maybe add new features, so check the version history if that interests you.

DISCLAIMER: As of now, there isn't really any error checking in the datatypes, so try not input strings or extremely large numbers
as it will crash and burn miserably. Also, If there is no suits showing up in the card graphics and instead it show up like "ΓÖú",
try changing your terminal font to either "Courier, monospace" or "Courier New, monospace".
